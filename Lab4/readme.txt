# Lab 4 - Handwritten digits recognition

## Information

* Course: Understanding Deep Neural Networks
* Teacher: Zhang Yi
* Student:
* ID:

## Files

* `lab4.m` - the MATLAB code file for BP algorithm
* `fc.m` - the MATLAB code file for feedforward computation. 
* `bc.m` - the MATLAB code file for backward computation.
* 'cost.m' - the MATLAB code file for cost function.
* 'accuracy.m' - the MATLAB code file for accuracy (evaluation index).
* `mnist_small_matlab.mat` - the MATLAB data file of handwritten digits dataset

## Instructions

**NOTICE**, the implementation has no external input.
Follow the code example in the courseware slides to finish `lab4.m`.

1. data preparation 
2. design network architecture
3. initialize parameters
4. define cost function
5. define evaluation index
6. train the network
7. test the network
8. store the network parameters
9. use trained network for application




## Submission

* Try different network layers with different neurons and plot the results (such as ùêø=2, 3, 8). 
* **NOTICE** tune the parameters to obtain a good accuracy as you can.
* submit your parameters and your plotted figures about cost and accuracy.
* submit a 3-page ".pdf" file as illustrated in example.pptx for L=2, 3, 8 (delete the example of L=5).
* Submit to email address of TA (ithet1000@qq.com)
* Use email title:
    ```
    DNN2019F Lab4 <student-id> <student-name>
    ```
    (Don't keep `<`, `>`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;` in the title. Just fill in your student id and your name.)
    TA will be using a filter to **throw away** any email not following such format.
* Deadline: 2019/10/10 23:59
